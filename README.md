FIOP (Full infrastructure in one project)
===

## Why?

Actually this project is not has the global goal. I just thought what do I need to develop the self project? First is resource to collect my documentation, second is the resource to plan some tasks and track them state, third is should be system to continue integration and continua delivery, fourth this is shoul be the system to work with test plans. In future another systems can be useful. And I have thought it will intrested to create this infrasctucrure self. 

Note: I know that for resolve this issues exist a good solutions some from tham is cometrial some is open source and free. And I do not wana to compete with them I just train my tecnikal skills.

## What?

The service with plugin system for build the workflow system as single service.
